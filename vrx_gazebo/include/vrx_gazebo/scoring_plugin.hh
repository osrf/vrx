/// \brief A plugin that provides common functionality to any scoring plugin.
/// This plugin defines four different task states:
///
/// * Initial: The vehicle might be locked to the world via some joints with
/// different constraints. This state is used to stabilize the vehicle and let
/// it settle for a while.
/// * Ready: If the vehicle was locked, it will be released in this state. The
/// task hasn't started yet, but the vehicle can be controlled and prepared for
/// the start of the task.
/// * Running: The task has started. The clockwatch task starts too.
/// * Finished: The maximum allowed task time has been reached (time out) or
/// the task has been completed. Other plugins derived from the ScoringPlugin
/// class can call the Finish() method to trigger the completion of the task.
///
/// The plugin also exposes a pair of methods [Set]Score() for setting and
/// getting a score.
///
/// Derived plugins can also override the OnReady(), OnRunning(),
/// and OnFinished() to be notified when the task transitions into the "ready".
/// "running" or "finished" states respectively.
///
/// The plugin publishes task information on a ROS topic at 1Hz.
///
/// This plugin uses the following SDF parameters:
///
/// <vehicle>: Required parameter (string type) with the name of the main
/// vehicle to be under control during the task.
///
/// <task_name>: Required parameter specifying the task name (string type).
///
/// <task_info_topic>: Optional parameter (string type)
/// containing the ROS topic name to publish the task stats. The default
/// topic name is /vrx/task/info .
///
/// <contact_debug_topic>: Optional parameter (string type)
/// containing the ROS topic name to
/// publish every instant a collision with the wamv is happening.
/// Default is /vrx/debug/contact.
///
/// <per_plugin_exit_on_completion>: Specifies whether to shut down after
/// completion, for this specific plugin.
/// Different from environment variable VRX_EXIT_ON_COMPLETION, which is for
/// every plugin in the current shell. Environment variable overwrites this
/// parameter.
///
/// <initial_state_duration>: Optional parameter (double type) specifying the
/// amount of seconds that the plugin will be in the "initial" state.
///
/// <ready_state_duration>: Optional parameter (double type) specifying the
/// amount of seconds that the plugin will be in the "ready" state.
///
/// <running_state_duration>: Optional parameter (double type) specifying the
/// amount of maximum seconds that the plugin will be in the "running" state.
/// Note that this parameter specifies the maximum task time.
///
/// <collision_buffer>: Optional parameter (double type) specifying the
/// minimum amount of seconds between two collisions. If N collisions happen
/// within this time frame, only one will be counted.
///
/// <release_joints>: Optional element specifying the collection of joints that
/// should be dettached when transitioning to the "ready" state.
///
///   This block should contain at least one of these blocks:
///   <joint>: This block should contain a <name> element with the name of the
///   joint to release.
///
/// <silent>: Optional element (boolean type) specifying if we want to
/// avoid showing the state messages.
///
/// Here's an example:
/// <plugin name="scoring_plugin"
///         filename="libscoring_plugin.so">
///   <vehicle>wamv</vehicle>
///   <task_name>navigation_course</task_name>
///   <initial_state_duration>10</initial_state_duration>
///   <ready_state_duration>10</ready_state_duration>
///   <running_state_duration>30</running_state_duration>
///   <release_joints>
///     <joint>
///       <name>wamv_external_pivot_joint</name>
///     </joint>
///     <joint>
///       <name>wamv_external_riser</name>
///     </joint>
///   </release_joints>
