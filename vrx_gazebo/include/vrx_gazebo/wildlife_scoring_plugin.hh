/// \brief A plugin for computing the score of the wildlife task.
/// This plugin derives from the generic ScoringPlugin class. Check out that
/// plugin for other required SDF elements.
/// This plugin uses the following SDF parameters:
///
/// * Optional parameters
///
/// <animals_topic>: The topic that publishes the animal poses.
///                  Defaults to "/vrx/wildlife/animals/poses"
/// <buoys>: Specifies the collection of buoys to circumnavigate, avoid, etc.
///
///   <buoy>: A buoy to circumnavigate, avoid.
///      <model_name>: The name of the model representing the buoy
///      <link_name>: The name of the main link in the model.
///      <goal> "avoid", "circumnavigate_clockwise" or
///             "circumnavigate_counterclockwise"
/// <engagement_distance>: At less or equal than this distance, the buoy is
///                        considered engaged. Defaults to 10 meters.
/// <time_bonus>: Time bonus granted for each goal reached. Defaults to 30 secs.
///
