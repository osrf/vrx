/// \brief A plugin for computing the score of the station keeping task.
/// This plugin derives from the generic ScoringPlugin class. Refer to that
/// plugin for an explanation of the four states defined (Initial, Ready,
/// Running and Finished) as well as other required SDF elements.
///
/// This plugin publishes a goal pose to a topic when it enters the Ready
/// state.
///
/// In the running state it calculates a 2D pose error distance between the
/// vehicle and the goal as well as a running mean error of all 2D pose errors
/// calculated so far. The current 2D pose error is published to a topic for
/// pose error, and the mean error is published to a task score topic. Mean
/// error is also set as the score using the SetScore() method inherited from
/// the parent. This causes it to also appear in the task information topic.
///
/// This plugin requires the following SDF parameters:
///
/// <goal_pose>: Optional parameter (vector type) specifying the latitude,
/// longitude and yaw of the task goal. If not provided, all values default
/// to 0.
/// <markers>: Optional parameter to enable visualization markers. Check the
/// WaypointMarkers class for SDF documentation.
