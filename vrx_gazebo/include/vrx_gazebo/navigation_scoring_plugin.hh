/// \brief A plugin for computing the score of the navigation task.
/// This plugin derives from the generic ScoringPlugin class. Check out that
/// plugin for other required SDF elements.
/// This plugin requires the following SDF parameters:
///
/// <obstacle_penalty>: Specifies how many points are deducted per collision.
/// <gates>: Specifies the collection of gates delimiting the course.
///
///   Each gate accepts the following elements:
///
///   <gate>: A gate is delimited by two markers (left and right).
///   The vessel should pass through the gate with the markers on the defined
///   right and left sides. E.g.:
///
///      <left_marker>: The name of the marker that should stay on the left
///      side of the vessel.
///      <right_marker> The name of the marker that should stay on the right
///      side of the vessel.
///
/// Here's an example:
/// <plugin name="navigation_scoring_plugin"
///         filename="libnavigation_scoring_plugin.so">
///   <vehicle>wamv</vehicle>
///   <task_name>navigation_scoring_plugin</task_name>
