# Virtual RobotX (VRX)
This repository is the home to the source code and software documentation for the VRX simulation environment, which supports simulation of unmanned surface vehicles in marine environments.
* Designed in coordination with RobotX organizers, this project provides arenas and tasks similar to those featured in past and future RobotX competitions, as well as a description of the WAM-V platform.
* For RobotX competitors this simulation environment is intended as a first step toward developing tools prototyping solutions in advance of physical on-water testing.
* We also welcome users with simulation needs beyond RobotX. As we continue to improve the environment, we hope to offer support to a wide range of potential applications.

## Coming Soon: Gazebo Sim Port
We're happy to announce VRX will soon be switching over from Gazebo Classic to the newer Gazebo simulator (formerly [Ignition Gazebo](https://www.openrobotics.org/blog/2022/4/6/a-new-era-for-gazebo)). Please see the [VRX Gazebosim Port Wiki page](https://github.com/osrf/vrx/wiki/VRX-Gazebosim-Port) for key details.

## The VRX Competition
The VRX environment is also the "virtual venue" for the [VRX Competition](https://github.com/osrf/vrx/wiki). Please see our Wiki for tutorials and links to registration and documentation relevant to the virtual competition.

## Getting Started

 * Watch the [Release 1.5 Highlight Video](https://youtu.be/-2BP2P3CHYw)
 * The [VRX Wiki](https://github.com/osrf/vrx/wiki) provides documentation and tutorials.
 * The instructions assume a basic familiarity with the ROS environment and Gazebo.  If these tools are new to you, we recommend starting with the excellent [ROS Tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)
 * For technical problems, please use the [project issue tracker](https://github.com/osrf/vrx/issues) to describe your problem or request support.

## Contributing
This project is under active development to support the VRX and RobotX teams. We are adding and improving things all the time. Our primary focus is to provide the fundamental aspects of the robot and environment, but we rely on the community to develop additional functionality around their particular use cases.

If you have any questions about these topics, or would like to work on other aspects, please contribute.  You can contact us directly (see below), submit an [issue](https://github.com/osrf/vrx/issues) or, better yet, submit a [pull request](https://github.com/osrf/vrx/pulls/)!

## Contributors

We continue to receive important improvements from the community.  We have done our best to document this on our [Contributors Wiki](https://github.com/osrf/vrx/wiki/Contributors).
