// The basic architecture of these Waves is based on the TweakWaves application
// written by Chris Horvath for Tweak Films in 2001.  This, in turn, was based
// on the SIGGRAPH papers and courses by Jerry Tessendorf, and by the paper
// "A Simple Fluid Solver based on the FTT" by Jos Stam.
//
// The TMA, JONSWAP, and Pierson Moskowitz Wave Spectra, as well as the
// directional spreading functions are formulated based on the descriptions
// given in "Ocean Waves: The Stochastic Approach",
// by Michel K. Ochi, published by Cambridge Ocean Technology Series, 1998,2005.
//
// This library is written as a working implementation of the paper:
// Christopher J. Horvath. 2015.
// Empirical directional wave spectra for computer graphics.
// In Proceedings of the 2015 Symposium on Digital Production (DigiPro '15),
// Los Angeles, Aug. 8, 2015, pp. 29-39.
